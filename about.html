                    <h4>Personal Statement</h4>
                    <p>I am currently in my 3rd year as an undergraduate student in Mathematics at the Georgia Institute of Technology. 
                        I was drawn to math because of its wide applicability and focus on problem solving strategies and understanding
                        rather than arbitrary memorization. However, I quickly realized that I had a strong affinity for education as well.
                        As I increased my technological abilities through coding classes, I found myself with many opinions about how 
                        technology could be used to improve our current educational systems, as well as a strong desire to implement these ideas. 
                        As a result, I intend to pursue a graduate degree and career in Human-Computer Interaction with a focus on Educational 
                        Technology. In the long term, I hope to create programs that will help get students excited about learning, particularly 
                        in subjects such as math, which are often viewed as difficult or boring. In my opinion, student engagement is the most 
                        important part of education. The interest of students and the resources available to them is what determines their eventual 
                        success and, as such, the success of our society. I consider it both a privilege and a necessity to play a part in making 
                        education more enjoyable, more effective, and more equitable.
